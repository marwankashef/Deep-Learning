Deep Learning Logo Recognition

The aim of this project was to explore logo recognition through the use of deep learning techniques.  More specifically, we aimed to not only accurately classify hundreds of logos but determine how similar an external logo was to one within our dataset. For the primary goal, we created a CNN-based pipeline to drive the multi-class classification â€“ for the latter, we built a proof-of-concept through leveraging comparative metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and Euclidean distance between pixel values.
